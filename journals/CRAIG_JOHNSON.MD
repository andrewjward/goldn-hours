    Worked on authentication of accounts with the team

    We wrote a bunch of python trying to get authentication
    to work with our MongoDB
    We tested a bunch with the FastAPI docs but to no avail
    we ended up needing assistance.

    My aha moment today was when I became driver at the end
    and got mad confused because my mongodb wasn't working anymore
    turns out I had to delete and recreate it because I populated it
    when testing to see if it worked when we first created it. Before
    we swapped mongo versions.

    Worked on displaying a map with the google api

    We had to setup a google account to have our api be able
    to communicate the right data. We wrote a bunch of jsx and
    javascript and messed around with the key's location a lot

    The aha moment today was when we figured out the error was
    caused by a keyword being misspelled very slightly. When
    center was named correctly it all clicked together.
