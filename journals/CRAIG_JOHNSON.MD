    // My Bday ðŸŽ‰
    Had bit of headache

    Today we worked on the pin form login and sign up
    and the logout button

    My aha moment came when we got the logout function
    from the jwt package working.

    Lots and lots and lots of bugs today no really big
    progress.

    Aha moment today did not come for me.

# MAY 22ND 2023
    Worked on CSS for Pin alone while others worked on
    different components

    Today we worked on in total the nav bar, the profile
    page, and the pin css all together.

    My aha moment was messing with the position of certain
    elements, position relative and absolute was key.

    Worked on authentication of accounts with the team

    We wrote a bunch of python trying to get authentication
    to work with our MongoDB
    We tested a bunch with the FastAPI docs but to no avail
    we ended up needing assistance.

    My aha moment today was when I became driver at the end
    and got mad confused because my mongodb wasn't working anymore
    turns out I had to delete and recreate it because I populated it
    when testing to see if it worked when we first created it. Before
    we swapped mongo versions.

    Worked on displaying a map with the google api

    We had to setup a google account to have our api be able
    to communicate the right data. We wrote a bunch of jsx and
    javascript and messed around with the key's location a lot

    The aha moment today was when we figured out the error was
    caused by a keyword being misspelled very slightly. When
    center was named correctly it all clicked together.
