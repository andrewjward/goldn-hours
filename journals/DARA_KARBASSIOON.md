Got the app up and deployed today. I am continuing to work on CSS and various other front end related stuff. Adding profile pics next to the posters name on the locationlist.js and to the map page.

Mainly had Jonathan and Andrew drive while continuing to work on deployment. We worked on the .gitlab-ci.yml file.

I started by fixing the size of the logo in the nav bar. We found out that we needed to add the __init__.py to the tests folder. Worked on closing some issues. Deployment is quite the challenge.

## June 5, 2023

We added some unit tests today and had some bugs with the navigation bar. I worked on adding some navigation functionality to each pin card on the map of the home page too.

We are all working on separate things this morning. I created and solved some issues regarding the nav bar, such as being able to access the profile page when not logged in and restricting making a post when not logged in.

        trying to fix the login problem

Today we worked on:

        Front end profile things

I am driving today. We are removing hard coded elements which should be dynamic. But we are having trouble syncing state across different components. Violet said that we should try using useContext or useReducer to solve this without Redux.

    Continuing defining our models for our FASTApi backend.

## May 17, 2023

Today, we worked on:

    Setting up authentication for user login and logout and making a token.

There was a lot of trouble and debugging going on that we had to have SEIRs come and help with. In the end we didn't find the source of the problem as we had the same code as our SEIRs, and ended up copying the code from one of them.

## May 16, 2023

Today, I worked on:

    Setting up the pins.py FastAPI backend. 

We started defining the models in our application.
