Today we worked on:

        Front end profile things

I am driving today. We are removing hard coded elements which should be dynamic. But we are having trouble syncing state across different components. Violet said that we should try using useContext or useReducer to solve this without Redux.

    Setting up authentication for user login and logout and making a token.
